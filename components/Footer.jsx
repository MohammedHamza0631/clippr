            How does the Clippr URL shortener works?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            When you enter a long URL, our system generates a shorter version of
            that URL. This shortened URL redirects to the original long URL when
            accessed.

            Do I need an account to use the app?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Yes. Creating an account allows you to manage your URLs, view
            analytics, and customize your short URLs.

            What analytics are available for my shortened URLs?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            You can view the number of clicks, geolocation data of the clicks
            and device types (mobile/desktop) for each of your shortened URLs.
